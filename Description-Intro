Title: "Visualization of Changes in Stock Correlation for the Standard and Poor 500 dataset";
Project Description:

We want to develop a script to scrape the information for the stock prices from Yahoo Finance for the years 2008-2017.
Consequently, we would like to format the dataset to include the information of the change of annual returns of every stock 
by looking at initial and closing stock price. Then, we will proceed to calculate the correlation matrix for the 500 stocks and use some clustering method prior to visualizing it into a possible network. A possible objective would be to compare the different clusters/patterns over time. 

Questions: How is a stock behavior or trend related to the market? 
How wide would be the variation of the change for markets over time? 
Are clusters related to a specific sector?
